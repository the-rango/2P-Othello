<h1>Othello (Reversi) in Python TkInter</h1>
<h5>Fall 2016: I%C SCI 32: Programming with Libraries<h5>

Othello (aka Reversi) is a stategy board game invented in the late 19th century. For ICS 32 with professor Thornton, I implemented a two-player version using TkInter in Python (and later an AI to play the game using C++ in ICS 46; but that's another story). Due to concerns with potential academic dishonesty, I have not included any of the source code here. 

Below is a video demo of main features.

(Since TkInter operates on a relatively low level with the operating system, no online compiler allows for hosting TkInter applications. Hence the gif and not a live working demo.)
