<h1>Othello (Reversi) in Python TkInter</h1>
<h5>Fall 2016: I&C SCI 32: Programming with Libraries<h5>

<p>Othello (aka Reversi) is a stategy board game born in the late 19th century. For ICS 32 with professor Alex Thornton, I implemented a two-player version using TkInter in Python (and later an AI to play the game using C++ in ICS 46; but that's another story). Due to concerns regarding potential academic dishonesty, I have not included any of the source code here. 

Below is a video demo of the following main features:
<ul>
  <li>Interactive & intuitive game setup</li>
  <li>Rule enforcements through message boxes</li>
  <li>Undo & restart buttons</li>
  <li>Visual game aid</li>
</ul>

(Because TkInter operates on a relatively low level with the operating system, no online compiler allows for hosting TkInter applications. Hence the gif and not a live working demo. Just know that it works:))</p>
